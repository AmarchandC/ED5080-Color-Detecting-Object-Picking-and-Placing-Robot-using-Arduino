ED5080 Mechatronic System DesignCourse Project


Key Points:

Color Detection and Sensing:

Developed an Arduino-based robot capable of detecting and sensing colors using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor.
Implemented code to read RGB values from the LDR sensor for different color channels (Red, Green, Blue) to determine the color of objects.
Utilized analogRead() function to capture LDR sensor readings and performed comparisons to identify specific colors.
Object Picking and Placing:

Integrated servo motors to enable object picking and placing functionalities in the robot.
Implemented servo control logic to manipulate the robot's arm for picking up objects based on their detected color.
Developed an algorithm to rotate the robot's arm to a specific angle to pick up or release objects.
Robotic Arm Control and Positioning:

Utilized a servo library to control the robotic arm's servo motor.
Implemented code to adjust the servo motor's angle incrementally to reach the desired position for object picking and placing.
Incorporated a neutral position for the arm to return to after completing a task, ensuring stability and repeatability of movements.
Iterative Color Detection and Task Execution:

Implemented a loop-based structure to continuously detect colors, pick up objects based on color identification, and perform tasks accordingly.
Incorporated delay functions to control timing and synchronization between color detection, arm movements, and task execution.
By showcasing these key points, you demonstrate your proficiency in developing an Arduino-based robot that can detect colors, pick up objects based on color identification, and perform specific tasks. Additionally, you highlight your expertise in using servo motors and implementing control logic for precise arm movements.
